Project 1 — Date Time Portal (Python + Oracle)

Overview
- Small Flask app that displays the current server date/time with seconds updating every second.
- Optionally logs visits into an Oracle database table `visits`.

Files added
- `app.py` - Flask app and Oracle logging route
- `templates/index.html` - frontend showing time and a log button
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `Dockerfile` - container image for the app
- `docker-compose.yml` - launches the app and an example Oracle XE container

Quick start (Docker Compose)

1. Build and start services:

```bash
cd python-portal
docker compose up --build
```

2. Open http://localhost:5000 to see the portal.

Create the `visits` table in Oracle

Connect to the Oracle container and run the SQL below (replace credentials as needed):

```sql
CREATE TABLE visits (
  id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  visited_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP
);
```

Notes
- The app reads Oracle connection info from `ORACLE_USER`, `ORACLE_PASSWORD`, and `ORACLE_DSN` environment variables.
- The `gvenzl/oracle-xe` image is used as an example; follow that image's docs for persistent volumes and configuration.
- If you don't want Oracle, remove the `oracle` service and the `depends_on` line from `docker-compose.yml`.
